Project consisting on Machine Learning with Python, a brief review about scikit-learn.

FOLDERS:
  1. Leukemia regression: contains Ordinary Least Squared, Ridge, Logistic, and Bayesian Regression. It is recomendable to create a project with the full project in order to run the code. Otherwise, load in terminal functions from the fns.py script, and then load model per model in the terminal.
  2. SVM: this code should be easy and direct to run, without the need of a project or script sequence.
  3. Clustering: IDEM than SVM.

FILES:

  poster.pdf  : Poster used in Machine Learning class Fall 2015, Duke University.
